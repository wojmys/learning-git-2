            I want it all (hey, yeah) I want it all
            I want it all, and I want it now <br><br>

            Adventure seeker on an empty street
            Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
            A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
            With the pain and anger, can′t see a way out<br><br>

            "It ain't much I′m asking," I heard him say
            "Got to find me a future, move out of my way"<br><br>

            I want it all, I want it all
            I want it all, and I want it now
            I want it all, I want it all
            I want it all, and I want it now<br><br>

            Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
            I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
            give me what I know is mine
            People, do you hear me? Just give me the sign<br><br>

            It ain't much I′m asking, if you want the truth
            Here′s to the future for the dreams of youth<br><br>
